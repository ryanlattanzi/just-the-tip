- R x64 

- RStudio

- scikit-learn for Python packages

Execution
--------

- Running Programs in R :
    Use RStudio to open and run the R files within the current directory

    1. Download the following files from [this link](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) into the newly created `data` folder
      - Feb(2017) - March(2018) and May 2018 for training.
      - Feb, April and June 2018 for testing.

    2. Open RStudio and run the file `condense.R`

    3. Open RStudio and run the file `getdata.R`

    4. Open RStudio and run the file `Analytics.R`

    (Or, the reader may use the `Training.csv` and `Testing.csv` files included in which
    the aforementioned data preprocessing has been applied.)
